# Friendship: An essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson

[Essay](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/essays-first-series/friendship/)

> Then, though I prize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own. It would indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking, this spiritual astronomy, or search of stars, and come down to warm sympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods.

> I will receive from them, not what they have, but what they are. They shall give me that which properly they cannot give, but which emanates from them.
