# Miyamoto Musashi

## Principle 2. Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor for others.

People spend inordinate amounts of time criticizing others. More often, when others are not even around to defend themselves. People also manufacture reasons to complain even when none exist.
As the saying goes, “_Man always needs a monster to slay, if there is none he creates one_.”
Musashi says that a man of focus should steer clear of engaging himself in such futile acts. Venting out your emotions is like a double-edged sword, it hurts the giver more than the receiver.
One thing must be understood – not everyone is created equal. Yes, it’s a fallacy when they tell you that all are created equal. The truth is we are not. Not everyone has the same skills. Not everyone has the same physical features, not everyone is handsome or beautiful – some are more, some less.
Musashi urges you to turn a blind eye to such inconsistencies because they don’t matter.

## Principle 3. Don’t let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.

If Musashi were alive today, he would deplore the form of romantic love that is practiced today.
Lust can overcome us and deter us from reaching our goals.

## Principle 4. In all things in life, have no preferences.

The problem with preferences is that they make us dependent. Our happiness comes to depend upon them. If your preferences are being met, you will be happy, if not, you will be mad.
Musashi advises keeping a tranquil mind and avoiding strong preferences. If you love to eat Potato pancakes with smoked Salmon on the weekend, and you don’t get it when you expect it, don’t blow a gasket…even if you have to make do with boiled potatoes.

## Principle 5. Be indifferent to where you live.

Mushashi was a wanderer. As a former Samurai and a Ronin later, he was used to traveling. People nowadays put a great emphasis on where they live, what kind of furniture they possess, or what their neighbor possesses.
Again, attaching yourself with material stuff causes disgruntlement. People get emotionally attached to their dwellings also.
Musashi was of the opinion that as long as you live a simple life, it doesn’t matter where you live. He would stress that in order to stay focused, you have to become indifferent to where you live.

## Principle 6. Don’t pursue the pleasure of good food.

Since Musashi was a wanderer, he used to eat simple food. Wining and dining are a no-no in Musashi’s book. He discourages gluttonous behavior and exhorts his fellow humans to not chase good food.
The problem is, when you are used to eating fancy, Michelin-star restaurant meals, you tend to become averse to eating a standard diet. This attitude can make you more extravagant and stimulate ways to satisfy your pleasures (Principle 4).
Musashi advises eating simple food, mindfully and in limited amounts. The purpose of eating is nutrition. Period.

## Principle 7. Don’t hold on to things you no longer need

Musashi knew a thing or two about the [minimalist lifestyle](https://bookjelly.com/documentary-review-minimalism/) it seems. Drifting from place to place taught him the ultimate truth. The more we own, the more we crave. It’s a never-ending cycle and it creates the fear of losing.
Buddhists don’t chase possession with a higher purpose (contentment, stillness). Travel light

## Principle 8. Don’t act following orthodox beliefs.

Mushashi had freed himself of the webs of orthodoxy. He refused to conform to the beliefs handed down to him. He believed that you throw your critical faculties and intellect out of the window when you follow the herd.
People who blindly fall in line, and conform to the opinions of the crowd often get stuck or live mediocre life. Musashi had an anecdote to this – solitude. It was his way of shielding himself from outside influences.
