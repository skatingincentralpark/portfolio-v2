## Quotes: Act don’t react

> A friend bought a paper and thanked vendor. Vendor didn’t so much as acknowledge the friend.
> Why do you continue being so polite to the vendor?
> Why not? Why should I let him decide how I’m going to act?
> The friend **acts** towards people. Many of us **react**.
> No boar will distract the equilibrium of his nature.
> If he responds with incivility, he would no longer be in command of his own conduct, but a mere **responder** to others.

> No one’s more unhappy than the perpetual reactor. His center of emotional gravity is not rooted in himself. But I’m the world outside him. He’s a mere creature at the mercy of these elements
>
> Praise gives him a feeling of euphoria. Which is false because it doesn’t last and doesn’t come from self approval
>
> Criticism depresses him more than it should because it confirms his secret beliefs about himself
>
> Mere suspicion of unpopularity rouses him to bitterness or aggressiveness

> We are as we see others. If you love others you are loveable, if you trust others you’re trustworthy
>
> We are least tolerant of those negative traits in others that we ourselves possess. If we are suspicious about intentions of others it’s because our own could be the same
>
> We create others in our own image.

> Most people are subjective towards ourselves and objective towards others. The reverse should be aimed for
>
> Be objective towards oneself.

> Strength and tolerance are partnered. Strong people are tolerant around everyone, their family, peers, bosses.
> Instead of asking what other people act differently to you, ask why you’re reacting the way you are

> The tolerant person asks what the reason is that someone is like that
