# Leadership Strategy and Tactics

## Take a step back

If you are getting overwhelmed, take a step back, breathe and check physiology.

- To gain a bigger picture of the situation
- Less overwhelmed by emotions

## Ownership and Dichotomy of Leadership

- Ownership is important for gaining respect in your team
- Aggression vs giving up control. Chatty vs silent. Discipline vs weak

## Modesty & picking up the brass

Willingness to do menial tasks once in a while builds relationships with people (give people favours, it’s not a waste of time to).

## Empower people by going with their plans

As a leader, your goal is to define the broad strategy and let other people devise the plans to achieve them. This gives people ownership and motivation to complete the tasks.

If the plan is 75% good, go with their plan without question. If their plan is under that, ask earnest questions. If their plan is bad, try and redirect kindly.

## Apply iterative decision making

- Rather than trying to find solutions for every issue on your own.
- Be careful of your urges to be the guy on whom everybody depends..
- Overcoming issues is a great quality for every leader, however, when you are too excited to become involved, your crew will wind up missing important possibilities for their own development.
- If you have the answer to a problem, don’t utter it suddenly! Try to direct others to find a solution to the problem by posing your team questions. Ultimately, this will lead to better outcomes compared to being the sole person whom everyone turns to whenever there is an issue.
