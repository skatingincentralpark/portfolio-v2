        Quotes by Ralph Waldo Emerson 1. Our greatest glory is not in never
        failing, but in rising up every time we fail. 2. Once you make a
        decision, the universe conspires to make it happen 3. The only way to
        have a friend is to be one 4. Don&apos;t be too timid and squeamish
        about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you
        make the better 5. The earth laughs in flowers 6. Write it on your heart
        that every day is the best day in the year 7. Unless you try to do
        something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. 8.
        When friendships are real, they are not glass threads or frost work, but
        the solidest things we can know. 9. You become what you think about all
        day long 10. Big jobs usually go to the men who prove their ability to
        outgrow small ones 11. To be yourself in a world that is constantly
        trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. 12.
        Enthusiasm is the mother of effort, and without it nothing great was
        ever achieved. 13. The only reward of virtue is virtue; 14. What you do
        speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say 15. How much of human
        life is lost in waiting. 16. People destined to meet will do so,
        apparently by chance, at precisely the right moment 17. The love that
        you withhold is the pain that you carry.
